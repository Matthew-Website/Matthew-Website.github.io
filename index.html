        <h2>Research Topic</h2>
        <p>Many people in society today often question whether or not we place too much value on technology and modern medicine. For my topic, I chose to delve further into this and really explore whether or not technology has run rampant, or if a sedentary lifestyle is more of an attribute.</p>

        <h2>How I Will Execute This Research</h2>
        <p>Whilst researching this topic, I will explore what one can do for preventing heart disease, as well as how lifestyle can play a role in preventing it. That includes looking into supplements, annual scans, prescription medications, and much more.</p>

        <h2>Articles Surrounding This Topic</h2>
        <p>In preparation for discussing this topic, I came across many different articles explaining parts of the topic that will assist in formulating a well-rounded answer. One article titled, “Sedentary Behavior, Exercise, and Cardiovascular Health” discusses some key components to a healthy heart. They mention the extreme heart mortality risks that come with leading a sedentary lifestyle and the conditions that could be prevented from living a more active lifestyle.</p>

        <h2>Wrapping Up</h2>
        <p>Overall, this topic will be very exciting to continue diving into. I have high hopes that I can find some very interesting and valuable information to share and hopefully come to a good conclusion about whether advancing technology or living a less sedentary lifestyle would be more beneficial.</p>
