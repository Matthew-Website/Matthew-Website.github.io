    <h1>Does advancing technology provide cures for heart disease or is it a 
source of a sedentary lifestyle that contributes to heart disease?

Research Topic
Many people in society today often question whether or not we place too much value on technology and modern medicine. 
For my topic I chose to delve further into this and really explore whether or not technology has run rampant, or for this scenario sedentary lifestyle is more of an attribute.

For the topic I plan to try and seek out research regarding the role technology plays in heart health and how far we have come in modern medicine. 
I of course also plan to seek out what the effects of lifestyle are on the heart, however everyone understands that lifestyle will directly affect your health and overall medical well-being. 

How I Will Execute This Research
Whilst researching this topic I will see what one can do for preventing heart disease and we can also look at what are some ways that lifestyle can help prevent it,
and ways that technology can help prevent it. That would include things like supplements, annual scans, prescription medications and much more. 

While researching this topic I would like to find out if there are any direct publications or articles written based on this comparison. 
There most certainly are people out there that study into this especially people who directly are involved in the development/advancement of our medicinal technology world. 
Some doctors often talk about how sometimes running can be the best medicine, but is that really true? That is something we will be able to find out.

Next, I would not be opposed to reading into some conspiracy theories about big pharma and how they impact our society. 
Many people theorize that if we were to be able to find a cure towards a big health issue in our society, that the government would never reveal this. 
The reasoning behind that being that if they were to find a cure and cure all of the patients they would then lose customers. 

Articles Surrounding This Topic
When scouring the internet in preparation for discussing this topic,
I came across many different articles that were explaining some parts of this topic that will assist in formulating a well-rounded answer and also possibly giving a different perspective into the matter. 
One research article titled, “Sedentary Behavior, Exercise, and Cardiovascular Health” mentions some of the key components to a healthy heart. 
They discuss the extreme heart mortality risks that come with leading a sedentary lifestyle and different heart conditions that could be prevented from living the lifestyle meant for humans to be living. 

The next article I looked at was unironically from John Hopkins Medicine and the article is titled, “Sitting Disease, How A Sedentary Lifestyle Affects Heart Health”.
In this article they even give analytical numbers just to show the degree of heart issues we have in America. 
They go over just how dangerous it is to constantly be sitting and also mention the predisposition it creates towards type-2 diabetes. 
In the article however they state, “sitting for long periods is directly associated with worse health outcomes including heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer.”

Wrapping Up
Overall, this topic will be very exciting to continue diving into.
I have high hopes that I can find some very interesting and valuable information to be able to share and hopefully come to a good conclusion of whether or not advancing technology,
or living a less sedentary lifestyle would be more beneficial, and depending on which one is, how will we as a society go about it?
